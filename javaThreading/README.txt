This project utilizes Java Threading to process a text file 
containing data describing the pages that individual users 
viewed on the msnbc website on September 28th, 1999. It presents 
the user with a GUI to answer the following questions:

    1. Are there more than __ users who looked at X?
    2. What percent of users looked at X?
    3. Are there more users who looked at X than Y?
    4. How many users viewed X __ number of times?
    5. What percent of users looked at X more than Y?

Each line in the text file contains a list of space-delimited 
integers 1-17, each of which represents a page (News, Travel, etc).
